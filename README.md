# 👋 Hello ・ Salut ・ こんにちは・你好 ! 

I have helped scale a product at a high-growth VC-backed start-up in NYC. I am passionately metrics-driven, and have defined, tracked and driven improvements in key company indicators;  am also really user-focused, from time spent leading user testing and customer service.

## 👩🏼‍💻 Projects
