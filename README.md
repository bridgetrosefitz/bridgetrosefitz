# 👋 Hello ・ Salut ・ こんにちは・你好 ! 

I work mostly in React / Javascript on the front-end and Rails for my APIs (and / or front-end). I love tech. I was team member #1 at a high-growth startup in NYC, and also have a bunch of experience with the public sector and human side of tech. Please check out my portfolio and projects if you’re interested.
